I want to implement a `prompt_toolkit` Completer that integrates with the existing completers in `@modules/ChatInterface.py`. The new completer should check if the input buffer starts with `/mod`, which is the model selector command. If it does, and the user begins typing a string, the completer should provide autocomplete suggestions for valid model names—both long and short—for all configured providers' models. The provider manager should be used as the reference to retrieve the list of model strings used for autocomplete.

Let's start drafting a plan document in /admin/model-autocomplete/master_plan.md.  For now, just capture the objective and have a look through the code and generate a high level approach for how we might do this.  Do not begin implementation.  Stop and await further instructions after you generate the first draft.

# LLM API Chat

## Overview

LLM API Chat is a command-line interface designed for seamless interaction with OpenAI's models, or any provider's models that adhere to the OpenAI API. This tool provides a streamlined environment for engaging with advanced AI language functionalities directly within a terminal. In an age where graphical interfaces dominate, this script emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility, allowing users to leverage the power of AI within the terminal.

## Philosophy

For developers.  For researchers.  For tinkerers.  As a developer, I want to be able to interact with AI in a way that is both versatile and respectful of my time.  I wanted a quick and easy way to ask an LLM a question and get an answer, without have to open a web browser or download a separate app.  I always have a terminal open when I'm developing, so it seemed logical to enable LLM access with a simple command. This script does that.

## Features

- Intuitive command-line interaction with the OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible models.
- Lightweight design that emphasizes speed and efficiency.
- Support for managing chat histories, enabling users to maintain context over numerous interactions.
- Code highlighting capabilities, ideal for developers looking to showcase or test snippets of code.
- A user-friendly command set for manipulating the chat environment without overwhelming complexity.
- A single prompt mode for getting a repsponse from the model and exiting.  Useful for scripting and prompt testing.
- Configurable system prompt for different use cases, both in chat mode and single prompt mode.
